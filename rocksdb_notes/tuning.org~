** SSD vs HDD
LSM-trees are a good data structure for disk hard drives, because they eliminate random writes. Sequential writes are advantageous on SSDs as well, because of block erase, but naively using an LSM-tree on an SSD is inefficient because the high parallelism of the SSD is not exploited.

SSDs have a multi-channel architecture.

*** Level 0 triggers
- kL0_Compaction_Trigger. Start compaction after this many L0 files are created.
- kL0_SlowdownWritesTrigger. Sleep (1ms) each write after L0 files threshold reacher.
- kL0_StopWritesTrigger. Stop all writes until background compaction completes.
