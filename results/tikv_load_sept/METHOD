5-node setup on Cloudlab. 

Load YCSB workload A using go-ycsb. 30 million records. Key sizes 64-2048.

Initial run: keys 1024-2048 not usable because run on different days at different
times. The system performance was too variable.
  First day: 7553 ops/sec, 9908 average latency
  Second day: 4207 ops/sec, 15414 average latency

Example script

#!/bin/bash

ycsb_path="/mydata2/go-ycsb"

${ycsb_path}/bin/go-ycsb load tikv -P "${ycsb_path}/workloads/workloada512" \
                -p tikv.pd="10.10.1.2:2379" \
                -p tikv.type="raw" \
                -p threadcount=160

QUESTION
Throughput drops continually throughout the experiment. Does throughput depend on the
size of the database, or is there a stall factor here? Would a 50% write workload
exhibit the same characteristic, if the system is under less compaction pressure?
