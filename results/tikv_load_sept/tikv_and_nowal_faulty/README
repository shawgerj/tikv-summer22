Experiment:

Evaluate TiKV and TikV-NoWAL (with extra flushing disabled) for value sizes between
64-512 bytes. Max performance improvement is 15%, but most runs are 8% or lower.

Note this experiment is a little faulty. Value sizes change, but the size of the db
was not fixed, so different value sizes reflect different levels of compaction.
