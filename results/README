Here is YCSB benchmark data generated with go-ycsb. 

Experiment setup:
3x TiKV nodes
1x PD
1x Client

All nodes are 40-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4114 CPU @ 2.20GHz, 192GB memory, SSD hard drive. 10Gps network.

Each benchmark is run with 5 to 120 threads to evaluate throughput and latency changes. 

default/ - unmodified TiKV setup. Default settings. 
nowal/   - modified TiKV so writing key-values to RocksDB does not use a write-ahead log. Otherwise default settings.
